Changes in 1.7.0:
 * fix typo in cheat notification dialog
 * fix bug where game was playable in pause mode
 * add Game Over screen to not start the next game without user interaction
 * game can now be resumed by clicking on the board
 * port to KScoreDialog
    - there is now one highscore section for each board size
    - the gravity option has its separate column now
 * port to KGameClock to solve several issues
 * break Pause and Game Over messages if they are too long or the window too
   small
 * add a translucent layer to Pause and Game Over messages to make them
   more readable on darker backgrounds
 * enforce chineseStyle gameplay for "reduced" tile sets
    There are tile sets, that have only one tile for e.g. the flowers group.
    If these tile sets are played in none-chineseStyle, this one tile face
    appears too often and not every tile matches another one with the same
    face because they are technically different (e.g different flowers).
    The solution is to enforce chineseStyle gameplay for tile sets that are
    known to be reduced. Those are Egypt and Alphabet for now.

 * some changes in coding style and naming schema to be more close to the
   kdelibs style
 * some general refactoring

Changes in 1.6.1:
 * Remove "prefer unscaled tiles" option, as it is meaningless with SVG
   tilesets.
 * Use shared KMahjonggBackground class from libkmahjongg.
 * Fix crash when repeatedly requesting hints. (bug:139070)
 * KConfigGroup API porting
 * KShisen now has configurable backgrounds and tilesets, shared with
   KMahjongg!
 * Implements the chinese style match for flowers and seasons, consistent
   with Kmahjongg and the more traditional game rules.
 * new KHighScore API
 * started implemented the "tiles can slide" rule
 * The user is now asked how to perform a move if there are multiple ways for
   the requested tiles.
 * Change label for the settings for the Tile can slide rule.
 * Little rewrite of the Gravity code.
 * Notify the user when he made at time good enough to be recorded in the
   highscores if he didn't cheated using Hint or Undo. (bug:139915)
 * Added some user notice and feedback in the status bar (bug:121808)
 * Fixed statusbar layout issue by switching from insertItem to addWidget
 * The game now restarts on changing the options Chinese Style
   and if started playing on change of the Tiles Can Slide option.
 * Remove frames around status bar items.
 * Add 'New' button to toolbar
 * showHighscore(): fixed wrong usage of KDialog
 * getPlayerName(): fixed wrong usage of KDialog
 * Conditionally use update instead of repaint when drawing the board. This
   speeds up substantially the tile selection with old hardware.
 * Use games-config-* icon for configuration pane
 * Added sounds to some of the games. More sounds to come.
 * "Game -> Restart Game" resets the game timer now (bug:144476)
 * also clear the redo history when resetting the current game

	* fixed a mysterious undo bug in combination with gravity

	* fixed menu accelerator

1999-01-03  Mario Weilguni  <mweilguni@kde.org> (v.1.1)

	* some board sizes did not match the entry shown in the
	menu. Fixed.
	* fixed a few warnings with egcs
	* removed my initial highscore

1998-07-17  Mario Weilguni  <mweilguni@kde.org>
	
	* moved to version 1.0 (it´s stable enough now)

1998-04-10  Mario Weilguni  <mweilguni@kde.org>

	* better highscore management. highscores are now score-based, not
	time based
	* board.cpp: fixed some bugs
	* the game doesn´t ask anymore for a name if the score
	  is not good enough for the hall of fame	

0.2.1:
  * [Robert Williams]  Added getHelpMenu()
  * [Robert Williams]  Added version.h

0.2:	added this changelog

	fixed a bug in the pathfinder (reported and fixed
	by Stephane Alnet <alnet@u-picardie.fr>)

	fixed a bug in the Board::lighten() function on 8-bit
	displays. Reported by Marc Diefenbruch 
	<md@filesvr1.informatik.uni-essen.de>

	Added a "Hall of Fame", mostly taken from kreversi.

	Added "About Qt" to keep the Trolls happy

	Fixed that "player-has-won-and-must-go-to-the-bathroom"-bug
	(the elapsed time was taken after getPlayerName() instead
	of taking it before)

	Fixed that "game-starts-before-midnight-and-ends-after-midnight"
	bug. This will allow games with a duration up to 68 years,
	hopefully enough for the common player. The first player who
	breaks this limit should contact me in the year 2065; I will send 
	him 20 bottles of Austrian beer ("Murauer") :-)
	
0.1:	initial release
