	* some board sizes did not match the entry shown in the
	menu. Fixed.
	* fixed a few warnings with egcs
	* removed my initial highscore

1998-07-17  Mario Weilguni  <mweilguni@kde.org>
	
	* moved to version 1.0 (it´s stable enough now)

1998-04-10  Mario Weilguni  <mweilguni@kde.org>

	* better highscore management. highscores are now score-based, not
	time based
	* board.cpp: fixed some bugs
	* the game doesn´t ask anymore for a name if the score
	  is not good enough for the hall of fame	

0.2.1:
  * [Robert Williams]  Added getHelpMenu()
  * [Robert Williams]  Added version.h

0.2:	added this changelog

	fixed a bug in the pathfinder (reported and fixed
	by Stephane Alnet <alnet@u-picardie.fr>)

	fixed a bug in the Board::lighten() function on 8-bit
	displays. Reported by Marc Diefenbruch 
	<md@filesvr1.informatik.uni-essen.de>

	Added a "Hall of Fame", mostly taken from kreversi.

	Added "About Qt" to keep the Trolls happy

	Fixed that "player-has-won-and-must-go-to-the-bathroom"-bug
	(the elapsed time was taken after getPlayerName() instead
	of taking it before)

	Fixed that "game-starts-before-midnight-and-ends-after-midnight"
	bug. This will allow games with a duration up to 68 years,
	hopefully enough for the common player. The first player who
	breaks this limit should contact me in the year 2065; I will send 
	him 20 bottles of Austrian beer ("Murauer") :-)
	
0.1:	initial release
