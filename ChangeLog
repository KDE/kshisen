0.1:	initial release

0.2:	added this changelog

	fixed a bug in the pathfinder (reported and fixed
	by Stephane Alnet <alnet@u-picardie.fr>)

	fixed a bug in the Board::lighten() function on 8-bit
	displays. Reported by Marc Diefenbruch 
	<md@filesvr1.informatik.uni-essen.de>

	Added a "Hall of Fame", mostly taken from kreversi.

	Added "About Qt" to keep the Trolls happy

	Fixed that "player-has-won-and-must-go-to-the-bathroom"-bug
	(the elapsed time was taken after getPlayerName() instead
	of taking it before)

	Fixed that "game-starts-before-midnight-and-ends-after-midnight"
	bug. This will allow games with a duration up to 68 years,
	hopefully enough for the common player. The first player who
	breaks this limit should contact me in the year 2065; I will send 
	him 20 bottles of Austrian beer ("Murauer") :-)
