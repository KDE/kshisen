Changes since 1.6.1:
 * add window title to Player name dialog
 * fix typo in cheat notification dialog
 * fix game to be playable in pause mode
 * add Game Over screen to not start the next game without user interaction
 * rework pause mode
 *  - game is now paused if the board loses focus (e.g. if a menu is opened
 *    or the application itself loses focus)
 *  - game can now be resumed by clicking on the board
 * rework player name dialog
 *  - use ui file for the dialog widget
 *  - OK button disabled until user enters something, preventing the
 *    highscore list to be filled with empty names
 *  - player can cancel if he does not want to be added to the list

 * some changes in coding style and naming schema to be more close to the
   kdelibs style

Changes in 1.6.1:
 * Remove "prefer unscaled tiles" option, as it is meaningless with SVG
   tilesets.
 * Use shared KMahjonggBackground class from libkmahjongg.
 * Fix crash when repeatedly requesting hints. (bug:139070)
 * KConfigGroup API porting
 * KShisen now has configurable backgrounds and tilesets, shared with
   KMahjongg!
 * Implements the chinese style match for flowers and seasons, consistent
   with Kmahjongg and the more traditional game rules.
 * new KHighScore API
 * started implemented the "tiles can slide" rule
 * The user is now asked how to perform a move if there are multiple ways for
   the requested tiles.
 * Change label for the settings for the Tile can slide rule.
 * Little rewrite of the Gravity code.
 * Notify the user when he made at time good enough to be recorded in the
   highscores if he didn't cheated using Hint or Undo. (bug:139915)
 * Added some user notice and feedback in the status bar (bug:121808)
 * Fixed statusbar layout issue by switching from insertItem to addWidget
 * The game now restarts on changing the options Chinese Style
   and if started playing on change of the Tiles Can Slide option.
 * Remove frames around status bar items.
 * Add 'New' button to toolbar
 * showHighscore(): fixed wrong usage of KDialog
 * getPlayerName(): fixed wrong usage of KDialog
 * Conditionally use update instead of repaint when drawing the board. This
   speeds up substantially the tile selection with old hardware.
 * Use games-config-* icon for configuration pane
 * Added sounds to some of the games. More sounds to come.
 * "Game -> Restart Game" resets the game timer now (bug:144476)
 * also clear the redo history when resetting the current game

	* fixed a mysterious undo bug in combination with gravity

	together
	* fixed menu accelerator

1999-01-03  Mario Weilguni  <mweilguni@kde.org> (v.1.1)

	* some board sizes did not match the entry shown in the
	menu. Fixed.
	* fixed a few warnings with egcs
	* removed my initial highscore

1998-07-17  Mario Weilguni  <mweilguni@kde.org>
	
	* moved to version 1.0 (it´s stable enough now)

1998-04-10  Mario Weilguni  <mweilguni@kde.org>

	* better highscore management. highscores are now score-based, not
	time based
	* board.cpp: fixed some bugs
	* the game doesn´t ask anymore for a name if the score
	  is not good enough for the hall of fame	

0.2.1:
  * [Robert Williams]  Added getHelpMenu()
  * [Robert Williams]  Added version.h

0.2:	added this changelog

	fixed a bug in the pathfinder (reported and fixed
	by Stephane Alnet <alnet@u-picardie.fr>)

	fixed a bug in the Board::lighten() function on 8-bit
	displays. Reported by Marc Diefenbruch 
	<md@filesvr1.informatik.uni-essen.de>

	Added a "Hall of Fame", mostly taken from kreversi.

	Added "About Qt" to keep the Trolls happy

	Fixed that "player-has-won-and-must-go-to-the-bathroom"-bug
	(the elapsed time was taken after getPlayerName() instead
	of taking it before)

	Fixed that "game-starts-before-midnight-and-ends-after-midnight"
	bug. This will allow games with a duration up to 68 years,
	hopefully enough for the common player. The first player who
	breaks this limit should contact me in the year 2065; I will send 
	him 20 bottles of Austrian beer ("Murauer") :-)
	
0.1:	initial release
