// Explanation of KShisen version numbering system
//
// Version numbers are of the form: MAJOR.MINOR.MICRO
//
// The MAJOR number should only be incremented when really major
// changes occur. Such an event is not currently foreseeable.
//
// The MINOR number is increased for every branch of KDE from HEAD
// (i.e. it's increased for the KDE3.1 branch, KDE3.2 branch etc.).
//
// The MICRO version is increased for every bug-fix to a branch.
// MICRO numbers >= 90 are used for development milestones in HEAD.

#define KSHISEN_VERSION	"1.6.0"
