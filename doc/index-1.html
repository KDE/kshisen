<P>Shisen-Sho is similiar to Mahjongg and uses the same set of tiles as Mahjongg. 
The object of the game is to remove all tiles from the field. Only two matching tiles can 
be removed at a time. Two tiles can only be removed if they can be connected 
with at most three connected lines. Lines can be horizontal or vertical but not diagonal. 
<P>You don't have to make the lines by yourself, the game does this for you. 
Just mark two matching tiles on the board. If they can be connected with at most three lines, 
the lines will be drawn and the tiles are removed. 
<P>Remember that lines may cross the empty border. If you are stuck, you can use the 
<EM>Hint</EM> feature to find two tiles which may be removed. 
<P>The game is over if no moves are possible and some tiles are left on the board 
(this should NOT happen if the option <EM>No unsolvable games</EM> in the <EM>Option</EM> 
menu is checked, since for these games there is at least one way to solve it, though it may 
happen that you choose the wrong way). 
<P>If you use the features <EM>Undo</EM>, <EM>Hint</EM> or <EM>Redo</EM>, no highscore will be generated.
