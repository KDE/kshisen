<h1>Shisen-Sho</h1><p>
This is a simple game, similar to Mahjongg. It uses the same set of tiles as
Mahjongg.

The object of the game is to remove all tiles from the field. Only two
matching tiles can be removed at a time. Two tiles can only be removed if they
can be connected with at most three connected lines. Lines can be horizontal,
vertical but not diagonal.
<p>
You don't have to make the lines by yourself, the game does this for you. Just
mark two matching tiles on the board. If they can be connected with at most
three lines, the lines will be drawn and the tiles are removed.
<p>
Remember that lines may cross the empty border. If you are stuck, you can use
the "Hint" feature to find two tiles which may be removed.
<p>
The game is over if no moves are possible anymore and some tiles are left on
the board (this should NOT happen if the option "No unsolvable games" in the
"Option" menu is checked, since for these games there is at least one way to
solve, though it may happen that you choose the wrong way).
<p>
If you use the features "Undo", "Hint" or "Redo", no highscore will be
generated.
