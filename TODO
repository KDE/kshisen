- weight group names in highscore dialog
- the highscore dialog stores the status of the gravity flag l10n'ed. This looks ugls if the player switches the game's language.
- change the way, scores are evaluated (e.g. make gravity x1.2 instead of x2.0 and add chinese style to the evaluation)
- get rid of the static sizeX and sizeY arrays; use Qlist<QPair<>> instead (this makes it possible to be more dynamic if it comes to board sizes
- solve the copyright issue (about dialog)
- show a message if no tilesets or backgrounds are found
- comment, comment, comment...
